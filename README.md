PolicyGaruda
============

This app auto-reads Privacy Policies and uses textual analysis and cyber-hermeneutics to warn the user of potential dangers.

Everybody usually skips over Privacy Policies and Service Agreements, etc., when installing software or signing up for social media. Policy Garuda will scan such policies and agreements prior to acceptance and, utilizing textual analysis algorithms, identify potential hot-spots and alert the user to egregious abuses of privacy or other potential damages which may be suffered by the user.
